Demonstrates a failing test with the `ID` and `TIMESTAMP` headers not being propagated with Spring Kafka, and specifically the Spring Cloud Stream Kafka Bindings.

Run the tests with:

[source,console]
----
./mvnw test
----

The test in `DemoApplicationTests` does the following:
. Starts up embedded Kafka with channels bound to consumer groups
. Creates a message using Spring Integration's `MessageBuilder` and asserts that the `TIMESTAMP` and `ID` are there before sending
. Uses the Spring Cloud Stream bindings to send the message to the Kafka broker
. Once the message is consumed by the listener, that is saved off for later assertions
. Assertions are made to demonstrate that the `ID` and `TIMESTAMP` are not there, but a custom header and payload are
